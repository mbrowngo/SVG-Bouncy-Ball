SVG tech demo one version with HTML5 controls the other with jQueryUI

I did get the basic idea of how to do this from code on the web, but I did not save the link. I apologize to the annonymous author here. I rewrote it and added the two separate UIs. I wanted the HTML5 UI to work, but there were some browser issues so I redid the UI in jQueryUI.
